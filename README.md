User Interface<br>
	To predict pneumonia using an image, it is essential to select a file that contains a clear and accurate photo, typically a chest X-ray or lung scan. This image serves as the primary input for a machine learning model, often a convolutional neural network (CNN), which analyzes the visual patterns and identifies features indicative of pneumonia, such as lung opacity or abnormalities in lung structure.

Pneumonia Prediction<br>
The uploaded photo displays the prediction for pneumonia, typically generated by a machine learning model trained to analyze medical images, such as chest X-rays or lung scans. This prediction indicates whether the patient's lungs show signs of pneumonia based on visual features like lung opacity, abnormal patterns, or structural changes

This X-ray image depicts a normal chest without signs of pneumonia. The lungs appear clear, with no evidence of opacities or inflammation typically associated with pneumonia. The air spaces are properly aerated, and the overall structure of the thoracic cavity is intact, indicating healthy respiratory function.

Diabetes prediction<br>
	The figure illustrates a user-friendly diabetes prediction system where inputs are provided in the form of numerical values. These inputs typically include key health indicators such as age, blood glucose level, blood pressure, insulin levels, and other relevant medical parameters. The system utilizes a machine learning model, often based on algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks, to analyze these inputs and predict the likelihood of diabetes. The user-friendly interface ensures ease of use, allowing users to input data directly and receive instant feedback on their health status. The prediction output may include a risk score, classification (diabetic or non-diabetic), or health recommendations, supporting early detection and proactive health management.

The uploaded photo indicates that the person has been predicted to have diabetes. This prediction is typically generated by a machine learning model that analyzes various health-related inputs, such as blood glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and insulin levels. The model processes these inputs and identifies patterns or risk factors associated with diabetes.
